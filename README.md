Coppola's Pizza

A small web app that was built as part of the Spring 2015 javaScript course curriculum at Epicodus.

This app was created as an exercise in Object-Oriented JS along with JQuery.

+## Functionality:
+
Coppola's Pizza is a website that takes online orders for a fictional (or is it?) pizza company. Users are shown a form to add pizzas of their choosing to their order (they have options for different sizes, toppings, etc.) Upon adding each pizza, the user can either opt to add another, or proceed to review their order and check out. A rudimentary receipt with cost breakdown is provided to the user.

+## Tests:
+
+Both tests for Pizza Party utilize both Mocha and Chai. Simply run the spec-runner.html file (located in the spec folder) in order to see real-time test results. Any additional tests may be written to the specs.js folder, and run in the same method.
